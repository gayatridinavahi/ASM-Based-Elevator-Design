# FSM-Based-Elevator-Design

## Introduction
The Elevator problem uses state machines to shift from one floor to another. The direction must be allowed in both ways. For ease, it is assumed that the elevator when present at floor 4 finishes a request from 5/3 before catering to the requests of other floors (catering to requests from immediate neighbouring floors). This design is easily extendable to varied no. of floors as per need and customisable to user.

## Working
This design has been done in three ways which are as follows:
1) state-machine based
2) CaseX method
3) Boolean Method

The working codes have been given for all three cases. User must correctly define the case he/she wants to use as per need before simulation.

## Results
The functionality has been verified and the waveform has been attached for reference.
